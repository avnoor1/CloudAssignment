Project Overview

This project estimates carbon emissions generated by taxi rides based on the trip distance and fuel consumption. The emissions are calculated using an emission factor of 8.89 kg of CO2 per gallon of gasoline burned. The project also compares emissions between rides with 1-2 passengers and 3+ passengers to evaluate the impact of ride-sharing on overall emissions.
Methodology

    Fuel Consumption: Estimated using an average fuel efficiency of 22 miles per gallon (MPG).
    CO2 Emissions: Calculated as:
    CO2 Emissions (kg)=Fuel Consumed (gallons)×8.89
    CO2 Emissions (kg)=Fuel Consumed (gallons)×8.89
    Passenger Groups: The emissions for 1-2 passengers are compared with those for 3+ passengers to identify patterns and potential benefits of ride-sharing.

Key Features

    Fuel and Emissions Calculation: The script computes the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions for each taxi ride.
    Daily Emissions Comparison: A visual comparison of daily total emissions between 1-2 passengers and 3+ passengers is provided to highlight patterns over time.

Visualization

The project includes visualizations that:

    Show daily emissions trends over time.
    Compare emissions between rides with fewer and more passengers.

How to Use

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Taxi-Emissions-Estimation.git

Install dependencies:

bash

pip install pyspark pandas matplotlib

Run the Python script:

bash

python emissions_analysis.py

Alternatively, open the Jupyter Notebook:

bash

    jupyter notebook emissions_analysis.ipynb

Key Findings

    1-2 passenger rides generate more emissions compared to 3+ passenger rides.
    Ride-sharing could significantly reduce the overall carbon footprint of taxi services.

Recommendations

    Promote ride-sharing to reduce low-occupancy trips and minimize emissions.
    Implement dynamic pricing for low-occupancy rides to encourage ride-sharing.
    Consider transitioning the taxi fleet to electric vehicles to reduce overall emissions.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the impact of ride-sharing on reducing emissions from taxi services and provides a foundation for further exploration of eco-friendly transportation solutions.
